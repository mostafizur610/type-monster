                        <strong>Block Scope</strong><br>
                        Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of
                        the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or
                        conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from
                        within the curly brackets {}. <br>
                        Imagine a nested situation:
                        A block of code enclosed with curly brackets{} containing some block variables. <br> <code>{<br>
                            let a = 10;<br>
                            const b = 5;<br>
                          }</code> <br>

                        <strong>Global Scope</strong> <br>
                        The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables
                        and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of
                        that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable. <br> For example <br>
                        <code>
                            var name = "linuxHint";
<br>
                            function printName(){<br>
                            // the variable can be accessed inside here 
                           <br> console.log("This tutorial is by "+name);<br>
                            } <br>
                            
                            printName();
                        </code>

                    <div class="accordion-body">JavaScript is a single-threaded language. In other words, it can do only
                        one thing at a time. JavaScript executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few
                        smart data structures, gives us the illusion of multi-threading. The event loop is the secret
                        behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming.
                        <br>

                        <strong>Behind the Scenes — How does the magic happen..!!</strong>

                        <br>Javascript has a few interesting data structures that help it in appearing like a
                        multi-threaded
                        language.b

                        <br>1 — Call Stack

                        <br>As the execution proceeds line by line, the method calls are pushed onto the call stack in
                        order
                        of execution. Once the execution is complete, the method is popped from the stack.

                        <br>2 — Memory Heap

                        <br>Objects are allocated in a heap which is just a name to denote a large (mostly unstructured)
                        region of memory.

                        <br>3 — Event/Callback Queue

                        <br>The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the track for processing. It
                        follows
                        the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent
                        for execution.

                        <br> At some point during the event loop, the runtime starts handling the messages on the queue,
                        starting with the oldest one. To do so, the message is removed from the queue and its
                        corresponding function is called with the message as an input parameter. As always, calling a
                        function creates a new stack frame for that function’s use.

                        <br> Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built
                        into the
                        browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own
                        single-threaded operation.
